 - Collaborating with three others, our team created an application to act as a Content Management System for users of devices created by Lab 651. This app will allow the admin and users to login, facilitate communication with
        contacts associated with each device, and alter the status and threshold of the device.
     • My focus on this project has been building the API, working with Particle.io, Nodemailer and Twilio API’s, structuring 	        the database, incorporating passport, setting up register/login, and creating scrum boards.
     • Technologies used: MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js), Particle API, JavaScript, Passport, 
        Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Gulp.js, Angular-Xeditable, Heroku, Nodemailer, Twilio and SweetAlerts.
